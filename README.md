This is the reproduction of the paper 'Band-limited Angular Spectrum Method for Numerical Simulation of Free-Space Propogation in Far and Near Fields'

- Instead of using the numerical integeration result as the reference signal to measure the SNR, the extended ASM result is used.
- In this branch, the circular convolution was linearized, which provides a satisfying work.
